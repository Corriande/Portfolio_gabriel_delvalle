            <h2>An exciting second assignment!</h2>
            <p>
                Students being introduced to Python will find themselves bombarded by numberic thinking,
                new words and concepts, and the frustration of spacing. This is why after introducing 
                the basics, I like to grab their attention with a mesmerizing project. The 
                <strong>Dream Catcher</strong> is the second animation assignment students will start often
                on their second class. Despite its visual complexity, the process of putting it together is 
                explained with simple geometric concepts:

            </p>
            <div class="text-center my-4">
                <img src="assets/images/dreamcatcher/dreamcatcher_p00.png" alt="Impossible Triangle" class="img-fluid rounded">
            </div>
            <p>

                <ol>
                    <li> Arrange points into a wheel, and spin it </li>
                    <li> Arrange three spinning wheels into a triangle</li>
                    <li> Connect the points between each spinning wheels with lines</li>
                </ol>

                In the image below, the number of points in each circle <code>num_points</code> is set to 10
                and the <code>radius</code> is set to 50.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center my-4">
                <img src="assets/images/dreamcatcher/dreamcatcher_p0.png" alt="Impossible Triangle" class="img-fluid rounded">
            </div>
            <p>Already in this state, students find this animation vexing. As it moves it appears 2D and 3D at the same time.</p>
            <p>Next, you can twist the columns by making each wheel spin at a different speed, as in the image below.</p>

            <div class="text-center my-4">
                <img src="assets/images/dreamcatcher/dreamcatcher_p1.png" alt="Impossible Triangle" class="img-fluid rounded">
            </div>

            <p>Finally, to make the animation most mesmerizing, increase <code>num_points</code> to 100 and <code>radius</code> to 250.</p>
            
            <p>It was a student that discovered this final transformation of the Dream Catcher. 
                I had encouraged students to experiment changing the variables in this project, increasing the number of points,
                changing the color of the lines and the speed of the spinning to see if they could make their own
                versions of the project special. I had intended to teach them about the unique strengths of creating through code-
                how designing a project around a few variables allows you to create drastically different results with the tweaking of a few numbers.
                In return I learned what this project could really do.</p>

            <div class="text-center my-4">
                <img src="assets/images/dreamcatcher/dreamcatcher_p2.png" alt="Impossible Triangle" class="img-fluid rounded">
            </div>

            <h2>Dream Catcher introduces the concept of lists</h2>
            <p> 
                In order to draw a line between two points, the X and Y coordinates of both points must be known.</p>
            <p>
                We can create a list for the X and Y coordinate of each circle, such as 
                <code>topX</code>, <code>topY</code>, <code>leftX</code>, <code>leftY</code>, <code>rightX</code>, <code>rightY</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                With these lists, we can connect the first point of the top circle to the 
                first point of the left circle using the command: 
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>line(topX[0], topY[0], leftX[0], leftY[0])</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the above line of code, 0 is the <strong>index</strong> of the first item in each <strong>list</strong>. 
                The index of the second item in each list is 1, and the third item 2, and so on... 
                Indexes are what make lists great for storing information. 
                Each item in a list has a unique number based on its order in the list that can be used to retrieve the item or change it.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Every time you see square brackets <code>[]</code> think lists!</strong></p>

            <h2> Let's say you have a list of fruits:</h2>
            <p>
                <code>fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango', 'cherrimoya']</code>
            </p>
            <p> <code>fruits[3]</code> gives you <code>'cherrimoya'</code></p>
            <p>To change the second item from 'banana' to 'rambutan' <code>fruits[1] = 'rambutan'</code></p>
            <p> <code>fruits[4]</code> gives you an <strong>error</strong> <code>IndexError: list index out of range on line 28 in main.py</code></p>
            <p>An index error occurs because you've tried to access a position in the list that does not exist.
                Even though there are 4 items in the list, when we start counting from 0 the index only goes up to 3.
            </p>
            <p><code>fruits[4] = 'pumpkin'</code> would also give you an index error. 
                To add a new item to the list, you can instead use <code>fruits.append('pumpkin')</code></p>
            <p> To <strong>append</strong> a list is to add an item to the end of it.</p>
            <p> You can also multiply a list. <code>fruits * 2</code> would give you a new single list with all the items from fruits repeated in their order inside:</p>
            <p><code>['apple', 'rambutan', 'mango', 'cherrimoya', 'pumpkin', 'apple', 'rambutan', 'mango', 'cherrimoya', 'pumpkin']</code></p>
            
            <h3>Multiplying lists is an efficient way to create a list which is the exact size needed to store a specific number of data points.</h3>

            <p>Consider how in this project the number of points in each circle can be adjusted by changing the single variable <code>num_points</code>.
            Whether, <code>num_points</code> is set to 1, 2, 10, 20, or 100, this project will automatically make each wheel have that many points and connect each point between the wheels with lines.
            For this to be possible, the lists which store each X and Y coordinate of each wheel must be created to store as many data points as <code>num_points</code> is set to.</p>
            <p>This is why these lists are created in the following way:</p>
            <p><code>rightX = [0] * num_points</code></p>
            <p><code>rightY = [0] * num_points</code></p>

            <p>If <code>num_points</code> is 10, this will give you a list with 10 zeros:</p>
            <p><code>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code></p>
            <p>Now you have a list with a place holder spot for each data point you need to store.</p>
            <p>The animation requires that we continually replace each data point in our lists anyways,
                so these zeros will all be replaced by the first frame of the animation. But even if that
                were not the case, it is more <strong>computationally efficient</strong> to create a list of the correct size
                before filling it with information than to use <code>append()</code> to add each item. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Advanced Topic:</strong><br>
                Python automatically manages memory, so programmers don’t need to manually allocate it like in lower-level languages such as C or C++. 
                Instead, Python dynamically adjusts memory as needed to ensure the code runs smoothly. However, when a list grows dynamically using <code>.append()</code>, Python may need to allocate a new, larger memory block and copy the existing data into it. 
                This can add extra computational steps, especially in loops. By preallocating a list, we help Python avoid frequent memory reallocations and improve efficiency.
            </p>

            <h2>Looping through Lists</h2>
            <p>Here's an opportunity to appreciate the elegance of how two simple concepts can come together in coding.
                <strong>Loops and lists.</strong>
                The technique of cycling through each item in a list is a fundamental part of any coder's toolkit. 
                You will find it endlessly useful for a wide variety of projects and contexts.
            </p>

            <p>A <strong>for loop</strong> cycles through each item in a list.
            Returning to our list of <code>fruits</code>, by setting up a <strong>for loop</strong>,
            we can create a temporary variable with any name to be each item in <code>fruits</code> 
            as we <strong>iterate</strong> through the list. Why don't we name this temporary variable <code>f</code>:</p>

            <p><code>for f in fruits:</code><br>
                <span class="indented-text"><code>print("I love to eat " + f)</code></span>
            </p>

            <p> This will give you:<br>
                <ul class="no-bullets">
                    <li>"I love to eat apple"</li>
                    <li>"I love to eat rambutan"</li>
                    <li>"I love to eat mango"</li>
                    <li>"I love to eat cherrimoya"</li>
                    <li>"I love to eat pumpkin"</li>
                </ul>

                In the line of code <code>print("I love to eat " + f)</code>, the temporary variable <code>f</code> stands in for each item in the list as it loops through.
            </p>

            <p>The <strong>temporary variable</strong> in a for loop is often assigned to keep track of the number of loops, using <code>i</code>.</p>

            <p><code>for i in range(10):</code><br>
                <span class="indented-text"><code>print(i)</code></span>
            </p>
            <p>This will give you:<br>
                <ul class="no-bullets">
                    <li>0</li>
                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>2</li>
                    <li>3</li>
                    <li>4</li>
                    <li>5</li>
                    <li>6</li>
                    <li>7</li>
                    <li>8</li>
                    <li>9</li>
                </ul>

                <code>range()</code> is a python command that will create a list of numbers. When a single number <code>x</code> is input into 
                <code>range()</code>, the list of numbers will start at 0 and count up to <code>x-1</code>, creating a list the size of <code>x</code>.<br><br>
                Notice the range counts up to <code>x-1</code> because it starts counting from 0. This should seem familiar, as it's also how lists create their indexes,
                so that a list with 10 items will have 9 as its last index.

            </p>
            <p><strong>Now let's bring this back to the Dream Catcher!</strong></p>
            <p>No matter what the value of <code>num_points</code> is, the temporary variable <code>i</code> of <code>for i in range(num_points):</code> 
            will cycle through each number from 0 to <code>num_points - 1</code>, which will give us the index of each item in each of our lists, 
            <code>topX</code>, 
            <code>topY</code>,
            <code>rightX</code>,
            <code>rightY</code>,
            <code>leftX</code>,
            <code>leftY</code>, 
            which are each the length of <code>num_points</code>.

        </p>

        <p>Here's how we use <code>i</code> as an iterated index to replace the zero's 
            these lists start with and update each value throughout the animation as the wheels spin:</p>
            
        <div class="text-center my-4">
            <img src="assets/images/dreamcatcher/dreamcatcher_code1.png" alt="Impossible Triangle" class="img-fluid rounded">
        </div>

        <p>Here's how we use <code>i</code> to retrieve each item in the list in order to connect the dots between wheels:</p>
        
        <div class="text-center my-4">
            <img src="assets/images/dreamcatcher/dreamcatcher_code2.png" alt="Impossible Triangle" class="img-fluid rounded">
        </div>

        <h2>On Circles and Spinning</h2>
        <p>Many young students I teach love math! However, not all students learning python will be ready to digest the concept of 
            <code>sin()</code> and <code>cos()</code>. In this project trigonometry is used to create the points on the circumference of a circle.
        If students are excited to understand how, I will explain that sin is like the y value of a circle and cos is like the x value. 
    This can be a great way to allow students to play with trigonometry hands on and see the results for themselves!</p>

        <div class="text-center my-4">
            <img src="assets/images/dreamcatcher/circle_cos_sin.gif" alt="sin_cos_gif" class="img-fluid rounded">
        </div>

        <p>However, for students who are not ready to absorb trigonometry concepts, <strong>understanding <code>sin()</code> and <code>cos()</code> is not necessary
        to the core lesson of this project, which is using lists and loops!</strong> </p>
        <p>For these students, I instead emphasize the lesson that <strong>knowing math
            helps you do awesome things with coding!</strong> Just that is a strong take-away from this project.</p>

        <p>For younger students, this project can be used to discuss the more accessible math concepts of angles and radians.</p>

        <p>Notice the line of code <code>angle_step = angle * i + spin</code></p>
        <p><code>angle * i</code> distributes points equally spaced around the circle. Then adding <code>spin</code> makes them spin.</p>
        <p><code>spin</code> starts at 0 and is increased by 1 radian with each loop of the <code>draw()</code> function. Notice at the bottom of the code, <code>spin += radians(1)</code></p>
        <p>This is like saying, for each equally spaced point on the circle, move each over by 1 degree, then 2 degrees, then 3 degrees... Each point will eventually be moved over by 360 degrees, returning each to their starting point when <code>spin</code>, was 0, at which point each will be moved over 361 degrees, which is visually the same as being moved over 1 degree.</p>
        <p>To change the speed of the spinning, you can simply increase <code>spin</code> by a larger number of radians. So, to make all three wheels spin at different speeds, create new variables <code>spin2</code> and <code>spin3</code>, and increase each by a different rate:</p>
        <p><code>spin += radians(1) <br>
                spin2 += radians(2) <br>
                spin3 += radians(3) </code></p>

        <p> While many of my projects use spinning and circular distribution, trigonometry is only needed in 2D. </p>
        <h3>Spinning in Processing is easier in 3D! </h3>
        <h3>As you will see in the next project!</h3>
